Create a new project called MyDuka with the following files: -main.py -database.py

Open up a new terminal and run the following commands:

pip install flask
pip install psycopg2-binary
TABLES -> Products , Sales , Stock, Users Open sql shell create a new database create database myduka; connect to myduka d. atabase \c myduka

run the following commands

products table CREATE TABLE products ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, buying_price NUMERIC(20, 2) NOT NULL CHECK (buying_price >= 0), selling_price NUMERIC(20, 2) NOT NULL CHECK (selling_price >= 0) );

stock table CREATE TABLE stock ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, pid INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES products(id) ON DELETE CASCADE, stock_quantity INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (stock_quantity >= 0), created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP );

sales table CREATE TABLE sales ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, pid INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES products(id) ON DELETE CASCADE, quantity INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (quantity > 0), created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP );

users CREATE TABLE users ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, full_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE, phone_number VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL );

pip -> pip installs packages

Psycopg2 -> A database driver or adapter used to connect Python to a Postgres database -> To estabish this connection , we use a function called psycopg2.connect() -> which takes some parameters important for establishing a db connection

psycopg2.connect() - a function used to establish a new connection to a postgres db -> It takes some arguments: 1.host - on what server is my database located? - host = 'localhost' localhost : my own device -> database is locally hosted on my device

2.port -> where in my device is the Postgres service running -> Postgres runs on port 5432 by default port = '5432' 3.user - username attached to a Postgres user user = 'postgres' 4.password - password attached to a Postgres user for login password = '1234' 5.dbname - the database you intend to connect to dbname = 'myduka'

127.0.0.1 build an app -> deploy it on cloud to make it available online -> an ip address is assigned to your application

179.181.200.120 domain name -> a human friendly name attached to an ip address https://meet.google.com/dsh-idtb-oqb

cur - an object / tool for performing database operations db operations - select , insert , update , delete

C - create - insert R - read. - select U - update. - update D - delete - delete

cur.execute() - a function used to execute sql queries cur.fetchall() - a function used to retrieve data from Postgres to Python

insert into products(name, buying_price,selling_price)values('bread',50,60); insert into products(name, buying_price,selling_price)values('milk',50,60);

our data format - a list of tuples

Task

insert two record of sales in sql shell and use psycopg2 to display them in your terminal

brush up on the following concepts: -> SQL ( sql queries , joins , aggregate functions , group by) -> Python ( data types, lists and tuples , for loops, if statements & functions) w3schools & geeks for geeks

Inserting data using psycopg2 insert into table_name(columns....)values(...) conn.commit() - a function meant to commit / save db changes

Optimize our queries in psycopg2 using functions -> Functions : block of reusable code meant to perform a specifc task

why use functions? 1.Reusability - use parameters parameters & arguments 2.Modularity - breaking code into smaller manageable pieces 3.Better readability 4.Code Organization 5.Scalability 6.Better debugging

transactions - more than one query executing as a single unit of work

sql injection select email,password from users where password = 1 OR 1 == 1 1 OR 1 == 1

Task 1.Using functions write code to: -> get_stock() -> insert sales() -> insert_stock()

2.Write sql queries that fetch the following data: -> sales_per_day => sales , date sales = revenue -> profit_per_day -> sales_per_product -> profit_per_product

15000 * 3 = 45000 (quantity , selling_price , date)

sales per day select date(sales.created_at) as date, sum(sales.quantity * products.selling_price) as total_sales from sales join products on products.id = sales.pid group by date;

profit per day select date(sales.created_at) as date, sum(sales.quantity *( products.selling_price - products.buying_price)) as total_sales from sales join products on products.id = sales.pid group by date;

sales per product select products.name as p_name , sum(sales.quantity * products.selling_price) as total_sales from products join sales on sales.pid = products.id group by p_name;

profit per product select products.name as p_name , sum(sales.quantity *( products.selling_price - products.buying_price)) as total_sales from products join sales on sales.pid = products.id group by p_name;

Multiline strings ->Enable you to have a string that spans more than one line -> it uses tripple opening & closing brackets

OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING - OOP -> Broadly we have 2 categories of data types: 1.Inbuilt data types -> data types that come with the programming language -> str, int, float ,bool , lists , tuples... 2.Custom data types -> data types created by the programmer -> this is useful in representing data outside the predefined data types -> This is enabled by OOP (use of classes and objects)

OOP - a programming paradigm where we build programs around classes and objects Class - a template / blueprint for creating objects Object - an instance of a class

Any class has the following 3 things: 1.Identity - every class has a unique name to identify it e.g class Laptop, class Dog 2.State : variables / data / attributes contained in a class =>variables : what does a class have? 3.Behaviour : what can a class do? -> enabled by functions functions inside a class are called methods

class Laptop: identity : Laptop state: ram , processors ,e.t.c behaviour : power on, power off, code, create files

generate identity,state and behaviour for the following classes: 1.Horse 2.Student 3.Car

class Student: identity : Student state: name , student_no , course , age behaviour : learn, sleep, eat, do_exams

class Horse : identity : Horse state : name, age , breed , can_race behaviour: run , race, sleep, eat

Method - any function inside a class Constructor - a special method that is automatically called when creating an object. It is used to initialize objects with data ->def init()

dunder methods - double underscore methods

self - refers to the object being created

Behaviour - what can a class do? -> defined by functions(methods)

TASK 1.Create a class called BankAccount with the attributes: - account number , balance , owner name , date opened
2.Add some behaviour to the above class using the methods: - deposit() - withdraw() - check_balance() -display_info() -close_account()
3.Create two BankAccount objects that can deposit , withdraw , check balance display info and close account

def close_account(self,account): del account print(f'account {account} was successfuly deleted')

Inheritance - method overriding Abstraction Encapsulation Polymorphism - method overloading ----------geeksforgeeks----------

Introduction to Flask Internet - global connection between various devices that allows communication between them www - a service that allows you to connect to the internet via the browser server - a device connected to the internet meant to store and share information domain - a user friendly name for an ip address ip address - a number used to uniquely dentify a device on a network -> ipv4 and ipv6 url - the full address used to access a web application e.g https://meet.google.com/dsh-idtb-oqb hosting - uploading your application resources on a server to make it avaiable and visible to everyone

plan -> requirements gathering -> design -> buiding (coding) -> testing -> deployment -> maintenance

framework vs library

192.108.220.220 -> www.google.com

Parts of a URL 1.Protocol - tells the browser how to communicate (http or https) http - hyper text transfer protocol - sends data as raw text https - hyper text transfer protocol secure - data encryption - ssl certificate 2.Domain name 3.Path - specific resource to be accessed in an application 4.Port

Framework vs Library -> The concept of building a house

Scenario 1 ---> Framework David intends to build a house. he recognizes that he isnt a construction expert. he decides to enlist the help of construction professionals (architects , engineers, construction workers). David has to trust the judgement of these professionals. The process becomes much easier but it also becomes less flexible and expensive.

Scenario 2 --Library Mitchelle also trying to build a house. She decides she doesnt need the help of any professionals and does it herself.The process becomes much harder but flexible

framework - a prebuilt structure of code and tools meant to help developers build apps by not having to code everything from scratch -Helps you build apps quicker and better but it has very strict guidelines

Examples 1.Python -> Flask, FastAPI , Django 2.Java -> Spring 3.C# -> .NET 4.JavaScript -> React, Angular, Vue , Svelte 5.Golang -> Chi, Gin 6.NodeJS -> Express 7.Ruby -> Ruby on Rails 8.PHP -> Laravel

FLASK -> A Python framework used to build web applications

Routing in FLASK -> A mechanism that maps / connects URLS to Python functions. It is a system for resource navigation

To execute routing in Flask we use a decorator function called @app.route() decorator function - a function that modifies or determines the behaviour of another function .In Python decorator functions have the '@' prefix @app.route() can take some parameters: 1.Rule / Path -> the specific resource to be accessed e..g /login /register /products 2.Method

@app.route('/') --> decorator function def home(): --> view function return "Hello World" --> resource / data to be returned

Note -> View functions cannot have the same names

app.run() - start your server and run your application

Returning full html pages with Flask -> to return html files we use a function called render_template() imported from flask -> you need the following project structure

Myduka -> static : contains all static files e.g. css , images , videos , favicons -> templates : contains all html files -> a single html file is called a template Template Inheritance -> reduces redundancy in page creation by having one base file with all common features of all pages then subsequently have all other pages inherit from it -> Inheritance is enabled by blocks

{% block title %} defines the unique title of each page {% endblock%}

{% block content %} defines the unique content of each page {% endblock %}

displaying data in flask -> to display data from Python in html we use Jinja: Jinja - is a templating engine integrated with Flask to render dynamic html pages -> It is simply syntax -> How to use Jinja Syntax: 1.When using Jinja to display variables / data ===> {{}} 2.When using control structures ===> {% %}

Control Structures - building blocks of a programming langauge 1.Sequence - a program executes top to bottom left to right 2.Iteration - looping 3.Selection - decision making (conditional statements)

Task -> Display sales and stock data using datatables

Posting data in Flask Posting : move data from the client side to the server side

Posting data workflow 1.A user is provided with a form to fill 2.User fills and submits the form 3.The form is submitted to a route in Flask for processing 4.Form data is then extracted using the request object Note -> data from the form is sent in key-value pair format *request object has 2 methods: => request.form : used to extract form data using its key => request.method : used by the server to determine what method has been used

5.Process data and store it 6.Redirect the user redirect - take the user to another resource -> use the redirect() function which takes url_for() as an argument -> redirect(url_for(' name of the view function' ))

form checklist 1.action attribute -> in what route is the form to be submitted e.g /add_products 2.method attribute method - determines what a server does with data / a resource 3.name attribute -> the key used by the server to extract form data 4.input type 5.button of type submit

methods 1.GET - getting / retrieving data from a server e.g displaying products in an interface 2.POST -> sending data to a server from a client e.g. registering a user ,login , add products, making sales , sending tweets 3.PUT - update an existing resource / data e.g. changing product name , updating password 4.DELETE - getting rid of a resource e.g. deleting products, profile

Note - data from the form is of type string

p_name:"bread" b_price:55 s_price:60

task =>Post stock and sales data using a form and two routes: /add_sales , /add_stock

making purchases => add products -> name,bp,sp => add stock on existing products => making sales => reduce

bread, 60,65 100 80 20 - remaining stock

80

myduka=# select * from stock; id | pid | stock_quantity | created_at
----+-----+----------------+---------------------------- 1 | 3 | 55| 2026-04-10 15:06:58.088418 1 | 3 | 50| 2026-04-10 15:06:58.088418

total stock = 105

[(105,)]

myduka=# select * from sales; id | pid | quantity | created_at
----+-----+----------+---------------------------- 3 | 3 | 50 | 2026-04-10 15:06:40.615398 4 | 3 | 20 | 2026-04-13 20:21:39.976895

total sold = 70

remaining = total stock per product - total sold per product

Bread , 60, 65 -> add no stock (none) -> 0 -> make no sales (none) -> 0

Bread , 60, 65 -> add 100 of stock on it (100) -> make no sales (none) - 0

zero and none

zero => 1000 - 1000

flash notifications authentication

Task Have products and stock forms inside modals Test making sales with checking available stock

Flash messaging -> One time notifications to the user based on some action e.g. action -> adding a product notificatins -> added product successfully

-> we use flash() -> a function that takes two arguments: 1.Message -> specific message to be displayed 2.Message category - categories of messages based on type

Message categories 1.Successful responses /messages -> green 2.Error / danger messages -> red 3.Warning messages -> yellow 4.Informational messages -> blue

Note -> Flash messages are stored in a session cookie (in the browser) -> Any data stored in cookie needs a secret key for encryption

User Registration and Authentication

1.A user is provided with a form to fill / register 2.A user fills the form with user details and submits it 3.Form is submitted to register route for processing 4.Request object extracts form details using request.form method 5.Check whether the user exists - using email if user exists : -> alert them & redirect them to login if user doesnt exist -Hash the user's password for protection -Insert the new user into users table

hashing -> converting data from plain text to a complex format that cant be easily deciphered

1234 ---> n99dnuc99jje99djh99ejd99dd abcde -> 99en8ehdxjjdskkkdkkdkkdkkdkd -> Hashing always produces the same output

rainbow table attacks salting -> add random text to plain passwords so that hashes become more complex

1234 - n99dnuc99jje99djh99ejd99dd 1234xiikdnjicicj -> 99enjucx99djuc8ichjjc89injc99ejjd9idjdjkdoodiodoidji

plain text password + salt => hash it with an encryption algorithm (bcrypt)

pip install flask_bcrypt

Hashing history

id | full_name | email | phone_number | password

User login 1.User is provided with a form to login with email & password 2.User fills form and submits it to login route 3.Flask extracts login creds using request object 4.Use email to confirm that the user is a registered 5.If user doesnt exist: -> alert them to register instead 6.if user exists: -> confirm that user pasword is correct if password is correct: - user is redirected to login if password is incorrect: -alert user to attempt another password input

1234

(1, 'Jane', 'janedoe@mail.com', '0774981928', '$2b$12$qkfAKQKQvaXYvPMG71b/cOnYvk/p2OPKcPMPcVVuhO.NoAx40vDfG')

1234 != $2b$12$qkfAKQKQvaXYvPMG71b/cOnYvk/p2OPKcPMPcVVuhO.NoAx40vDfG

hashing is a one way function

session -> data used by the server to remember an authenticated user session data will be stored in a cookie and signed using your secret key session stores data in key value pair format

DATA VISUALIZATION -> represent data using visual aids: -> sales and profit per product -> sales and profit per day

Types of visual tools -> bar charts, line charts, pie charts, doughnut chart, frequency polygons, histograms, heatmaps, radar charts, polar area charts

bar charts -> sales and profit per product -> x axis : product names -> y axis : sales and profit data line charts -> sales and profit per day -> x axis : dates -> y axis : sales and profit data

project proposal 1.Idea -> what you want to build 2.Justification -> what problem is your software meant to solve 3.List all database tables to be created 4.Create an ERD of the above tables showing clear relationships

Few concepts to look at 1.Python's virtual environment 2.Revisit OOP concepts - classes , objects, methods 3.Flask SQLalchemy - ORM -> better way to crgeate and manipulate db structures 4.Context Processor 5.Better login with Flask Login 6.Mailing service with flask mail
